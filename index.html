                <br><br><h3>The Journey</h3>
                
                
                <br>Crystal has always loved drawing and pursued any opportunity to do so through her childhood and early adulthood.
                Her work "Contemplation" was selected in the 2003 Art Express exhibition and displayed in David Jones. After a regional
                tour of New South Wales, Art express offered to purchase the work but it had already been promised to a very important
                art collector- Crystal's mum.
                <br>After school Crystal travelled in Europe and then settled in Brisbane, QLD. Her first attempt at exhibiting work as a
                freelance artist was in a local cafe- every piece created sold out. It was affirming and flattering but at this point,
                the idea of pursuing art as a career felt too indulgent and insecure so Crystal commenced her Nursing Degree.
                Whilst studying, Crystal enjoyed several artistic flourishes, always met with positive results and enthusiasm.
                Many moons later, while talking to a friend in the creative industries, she realised the truth. She was an artist. It
                was the thing in life she just "couldn't not do". It brought her joy, fun and contentment and the pieces created then
                created those feelings in others.
                <br>As a nurse she had always strived to make someone's worst day just a little bit better and now, through her art she saw
                she could create something that would bring someone joy everyday.
                <br>Crystals works often focus on the minutiae of life, the moments accessible to everyone that make us feel a little
                lighter, more connected, less stressed and more content.
                <br>She has recently branched into illustrated portraits and absolutely loves seeing a special person or family captured.
                You can also find her on Spoonflower if you wish to purchase beautiful fabric covered in her quirky illustrations.
